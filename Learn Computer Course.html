    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device, which accepts and stores data input, process the data input, and generates the output in a required format.
        A computer system has the three main components; <b>HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, and PEOPLEWARE</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
        <p>Hardware components of the computer system are the physical parts of the computer both visible and non-visible (those within the computer) to the user.  Some hardware devices serves as input devices, some output devices, some as storage device.</p>
        <h3>Input Devices</h3>
        <p>These are devices that accepts data as input from the user, either through</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keystrokes from the Keyboard;</li>
            <li>Gestures as pointing from the mouse and other pointing devices;</li>
            <li>Voice prompt through voice recognition software and mic attached to the system;</li>
            <li>Through special character reader (OCR), optical mark recognition (OMC), and others;</li>
            <li>Screen that touches and gesture from the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following are some of the important input devices which are used in the computer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard</li>
            <li>Mouse</li>
            <li>Joystick</li>

            <li>Bar Code Reader</li>
            <li>Optical Mark Reader (OMR)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Keyboard</h3>
        <p>Keyboard is the most common and very popular input device that helps to input data to the computer. The layout of the keyboard is like that of a traditional typewriter, although there are some additional keys provided for performing additional functions.</p>

                <tr>

                <td>It is used to enter numeric data or cursor movement.  Generally, it consists of a set of 17 keys that are laid out in the same configuration used by most adding machines and calculators.</td>
                <td>The Twelve function keys are present on the keyboard which are arranged in a row at the top of the keyboard.  Each Function key has a unique meaning and is used for some specific purpose.</td>
                <td>These keys provide cursor and screen control.  It includes four directional arrows.  Control keys also include Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up, Page down, Control (Ctrl), Escape (Esc).</td>
                <td>Keyboard also contains some special purpose keys such as Enter, Shift, Caps Lock, Num Lock, Space bar, Tap, and Print Screen</td>

        <h3>Mouse</h3>
        <p>Mouse is the most popular pointing device.  It is a very famous cursor-control device having a small palm size box with a round ball at it’s base, which senses the movement of the mouse and sends corresponding signals to the CPU when the mouse buttons are pressed.  Mouse has the advantage that it is easy to use, cheap, and moves the cursor faster than the arrows keys of the keyboard.</p>

        <h3>Scanner</h3>
        <p>Scanner is an input device which works more like a photocopy machine.  It is used when some information is available on paper and is to be transferred on the hard disk of the computer for further manipulation. </p>
        <h3>Functions of the Computer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Takes data as input.</li>

        <h3>Generations of Computer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">1st Generation (1940-1956) Vaccum Tubes: </b><p>	They are use tubes as gravity and magnetic drums for memory.  They are big and contain lots of space.  They are expensive to run.  These computer were limited to solving one problem at a time.  They relied machine language.</p></li>
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd Generation (1956-1963) Transistors</b><p>	They use transistors are circuity instead of Vaccum Tubes. They are smaller, faster, cheaper and less heavily on electricity use. They use symbolic languages which helps in creating instructions in words.</p></li> 
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">3rd Generation (1964-1991) Intergrated</b><p>Circuits: These were the first computers where users intergrated using keyboard and monitor which interface with the operating system.  This helped the machines to run several operations at once using a central program.  These machines are cheaper and are called semi-conductors.</p></li>
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">4th Generation (1992-2010) Micro-Processors</b><p>The fourth generation gave birth to the computer component like:</p><ol>
                <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
                <li>Memory</li>
                <li>Output Controls</li>
                <li>Input Controls</li>
            </ol><p> This is the beginning of revolution for internet.</p></li>
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">5th Generation (2010-Till Date)</b><p>	Some of these devices are remaining to merge such as voice recognitions. The main reason for this is to create machines that can process and respond natural languages and have the capacity to learn and organize themselves.</p></li>
        </ol>
<h3>Types of Computer</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Computer</b><p>A small, single-user computer based on a microprocessor.</p></li>
    <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Workstation Computer</b><p>A powerful, single-user computer.  A workstation is like a personal computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and in general a higher quality monitor.</p></li>
